Parameter Use Case â€“ Dry Run
****************************

When testing out a new protocol, it's common to perform a dry run to watch your robot go through all the steps without actually handling samples or reagents. This use case explores how to add a single boolean parameter for whether you're performing a dry run.

- Reducing mix repetitions to save time.
- Returning tips (that never touched any liquid) to their racks.
